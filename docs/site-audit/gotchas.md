## A pre-booking and the audit it becomes are two rows, not one

`Store_Team_App` books a slot before the Kylas enquiry exists, so the two halves
of one job live in separate `audit_orders` rows:

| | `pi` | `po` | status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Store pre-booking | `SRES-<STORE>-<ts>` | the enquiry ID | `slot_reserved` → `slot_converted` |
| The real site audit | that enquiry ID | the MD order id | `pending` → … → `completed` |

**The pre-booking's `po` IS the other row's `pi`.** That exact link — not the
customer name, not the phone — is how the two are tied together; it is what
`Store_Team_App`'s slot-availability check already absorbs bookings by, and what
`dropSupersededPreBookings` (`components/site-audit/views/bm/index.tsx`) uses. Name and phone are free
text on the reservation form (the phone is often the *store's* own number, shared
across unrelated bookings), so matching on them merges different customers — the
same rule as **Order attribution** above.

Every list that shows a BM their own orders drops a pre-booking once the audit
exists — either the linked order is provably present, or an SM marked it
`slot_converted` ("service created"). Applied to the RAW rows **before** they are
narrowed to one BM, since whether the audit exists is a question about the whole
table and the audit row may carry a different (or missing) BM link than the
pre-booking. A pre-booking still waiting on its service order stays visible: it
is the only record that the slot was ever held.

The ops/SM views take the opposite approach and filter both statuses out of the
main list with a dedicated pre-booking filter (`components/site-audit/audit-ops/views/`) — that is
deliberate, not an inconsistency. Don't unify them.

## `Array.isArray(rows) ? rows : []` turns a server error into empty data

`sbGet` (`shared/sb-client.ts`) returns `r.json()` **without checking `r.ok`**, so
any 4xx/5xx resolves a PostgREST *error object*, not a throw. Callers that write
`Array.isArray(rows) ? rows : []` therefore render a server error as legitimately
empty — indistinguishable from "nothing matched".

The same shape bites one level up, and that case is easier to miss: a wrapper
that catches into `[]` makes its CALLER's error branch dead code.
`fetchLeadDeals` catches, so `lookupEnqId`'s `unavailable` state — written
specifically so a Django outage could not be reported as an invalid Enquiry ID —
could never fire (fixed 2026-09-08). **When you write a distinct failure state,
check that the thing you call can actually fail into it.** `fetchClientTickets`
and `fetchClientOrderRows` call `fetchCRMLeads` directly for this reason.

Harmless for a count or a badge. **Dangerous for anything a workflow is gated
on.** It hard-blocked assignment in both ops views (fixed 2026-08-19, commit
`c589ec8`): the auditor/installer rosters load once when the view mounts but the
assignment picker reads them on every drawer open, so one failed fetch emptied
the picker for as long as the view stayed mounted, and the empty state blamed the
city filter for what was a connection problem.

The shape to copy when a load feeds a picker or a gate — see `loadAuditors` in
`components/site-audit/views/ops/index.tsx`:

- a non-array response **throws** (it is a failed load, not an empty roster);
- the last good data survives the failure, so a blip can't blank a working picker;
- retry on the same 8s backoff `loadOrders` uses, self-clearing on success, plus
  the poll and `visibilitychange` **only while the load is known broken** (the
  error flag mirrored into a ref, so the mount-once poll effect reads the current
  value without rebuilding its interval);
- the empty state distinguishes *couldn't load* from *genuinely none* — house
  style is soft-gate-and-surface, and "No auditors in this city" for a dropped
  request sends the SM to the wrong control entirely.

`loadShadowers`, `loadBms` and the deploy-safe `detect*` probes share the pattern
but degrade safely (optional shadower, free-text BM fallback, feature stays
inert). Leave them; they are not gates.

## Two render-loop guards

- **`use-owned-extras`' `deps` is a stable key for `people`.** The array's
  identity changes on every render of the parent, so depending on the array
  itself re-fetches in a loop.
- **`cat-analytics-panel`'s `nonce` is the redraw trigger** for in-place target
  edits, working alongside `targetsRef`. Editing a target mutates the ref and
  bumps the nonce rather than replacing state.
